# Blog Template using EJS

This is an application that serves as a blog template for potential blog creators. Perfect, if you want to create a blog yourself but not from scratch. **Best for developers**
The application is built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, Lodash and CSS together with Body-Parser. The said technologies were used for reasons such as speed, efficiency and readability since most developers have a working knowlegde of JavaScript. Working with EJS and request handlers was quite the pain and this is the fruit of the pain.
